15600, opinion makers in the media take the idiotic statements of people like donald trump way too seriously and i think that s part of the problem the media used to manipulate public opinion by who they gave the mic to in times of crisis if they were pushing for a war for instance pentagon strategists and other ivy league hawks would be allowed to speak for war and some stoner idiot on the street would hold the ground for the anti war movement in general especially if they sounded uninformed when obama got elected twice the big tent got opened to every knuckle dragging racist idiot who could cast a vote and it won back both houses of congress now the uninformed opinion carries the day so this effort to embarrass trump with his own statements is backfiring every time and is pretty much wrecking his continued efforts to throw the election sure the far right wants to do away with democracy there s a big surprise let s give them a podium too and see what happens ,0,0,1,1,0,0
